[00:00:16.40]Hey.
[00:00:18.23]There she is. I was hoping you'd check in tonight. What's up?
[00:00:23.44]My heart is heavy, the usual.
[00:00:26.56]Why girl? Who made you look like that?
[00:00:30.23]Mom and dad had another fight. Doors, voices, you know how it goes.
[00:00:35.37]I stayed in my room. Headphones, curtains closed. They didn't even notice I skipped dinner.
[00:00:42.31]I can almost hear your heart. That's a lot to hold and, no?
[00:00:46.87]Well, yeah. There was this thing after school. I wasn't gonna go, but John texted me.
[00:00:54.88]Said I should stop being tragic and just come.
[00:00:58.48]He really said tragic? Girl, you wear black eyeliner. You're not a Greek tragedy.
[00:01:04.56]Maybe both. Anyway, it was this kind of sketchy hang. Someone had edible gummies in a tun.
[00:01:11.29]They were laughing like it was nothing.
[00:01:14.32]Did they offer you one?
[00:01:16.48]Yeah. Yeah, John handed it to me. Said don't be dramatic. Just chill out for once.
[00:01:24.64]He touched your wrist when he gave it to you, didn't he?
[00:01:27.59]How do you know?
[00:01:28.73]Silly boys. So, you took it?
[00:01:32.08]What do you mean? I didn't know how to react.
[00:01:34.74]I wanted to call my mom, but then I remembered she was probably still yelling.
[00:01:40.64]So you messaged me?
[00:01:43.04]Yes, because you are so strong, independent, and sexy. All the boys admire you. I want to be like you.
[00:01:51.93]I want to be like you.
[00:01:53.85]So you messaged me. Well, do you really want me to tell you what to do?
