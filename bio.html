            <p>
              Social scientist, clinical psychologist, and media artist. She
              does academic research on how technologies work and their societal
              impact from a psychological perspective (specifically in
              artificial emotions).
            </p>
            <p>
              Based in Utrecht, Gema works as a lecturer and researcher. Her
              work blends art, science, and tech, with a focus on sound fiction
              and conceptual projects. She previously collaborated with CODE
              2024 on <em>ToyBoi</em>, exploring themes of AI ethics and the
              male gaze.

          <div class="artist">
            <h2>Ayoon Ro</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              South Korean-born, Amsterdam-based artist exploring the fragile
              tension between destruction and beauty through her paintings.
              Expanding her artistic practice into digital media, she works with
              animation, gaming, and extended reality (XR) with a focus on
              challenging how we experience memory and emotion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through her work, Ayoon invites us to introspect into the
              imperfect nature of being human.
